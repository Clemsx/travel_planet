Good to know:

- scraper.py content the class Scraper it'll scrap data from http://www.al-airliners.be/codes/oaci-01.htm HTML tables and finally save all the data to airlines_code.csv

- statistics.py is for the 2nd part, if you want to see graphical representation of data you have to go to main and uncomment the corresponding method and simply do:

```sh
python statistics.py
```

PS: I was not very inspired for the 2nd part :(
